React Extension Manager (REM)
======

React Extension Manager (or REM) is a package manager for third-party React Native Modules built using npm and CocoaPods. REM allows the base of React Native to remain uncluttered and small in size, while supporting native functionality such as Vibrations, MapViews, etc. that is not always needed in an app.

The 3 command line arguments that are available are: rem init, install and help.

Get started by using npm link
