React Extension Manager (REM)
======

React Extension Manager (or REM) is a package manager for third-party React Native Modules built using npm and CocoaPods. REM allows the base of React Native to remain uncluttered and small in size, while supporting native functionality such as Vibrations, MapViews, etc. that is not always needed in an app.

To use rem, init a project with a podfile and React Native extensions using <pre>rem init</pre>
If you add new React Native extensions at a later time, update the project using <pre>rem install</pre>
